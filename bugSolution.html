The issue stemmed from aggressive caching by the CDN being used.  The production build process wasn't properly invalidating cached CSS files.  While the development build updated styles immediately, the production deployment failed to do so consistently. The solution involved implementing a more robust cache invalidation strategy. This was achieved by appending a unique build timestamp or hash to the CSS file name during the build process. This ensured that the CDN would always serve the most recent version of the stylesheet.  Additionally, we investigated and ruled out issues with conflicting class names, incorrect build configuration, and other more common sources of the error.
