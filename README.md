This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS styles apply inconsistently in a production environment. The bug is characterized by the intermittent application of Tailwind classes, working correctly in development but failing intermittently in production. The solution involves a detailed examination of build processes, caching mechanisms, and the potential impact of CDNs on the integrity of CSS files.  The `bug.html` file showcases the problematic code, and `bugSolution.html` demonstrates the fix.  This problem highlights the importance of rigorously testing deployment processes, particularly when employing asset optimization techniques.
