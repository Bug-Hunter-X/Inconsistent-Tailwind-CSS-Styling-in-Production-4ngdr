I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  The HTML structure seemed correct, and the Tailwind configuration appeared fine, but the styles weren't rendering.  I tried purging unused styles, rebuilding the CSS, and checking for conflicting class names, but nothing worked.  The issue only manifested in production; the development environment rendered the styles as expected. This was particularly frustrating because the problem was inconsistent; sometimes the styles would apply correctly, other times they wouldn't.
